#+DESCRIPTION: Git bare repository of my messy dotfiles

These dotfiles are tracked using a git bare repository and need these [[https://gitlab.com/michesp42/local-scripts][scripts]] work properly.

* Set up for git bare repo

These are the steps for setting up this git bare repository in case I forget (which I probably will).

** Step 1: Initialize repository

Create and initialize the git bare repository with the following commands.

#+begin_src bash

  mkdir --parent ~/.local/dotfiles/
  cd ~/.local/dotfiles
  git init --bare

#+end_src

The directory ~$HOME/.local/dotfiles~ can be replaced with any sensible directory you prefer.

** Step 2: Add alias

For ~git~ to know when we want to work with our dotfiles we have to specify a couple of flags, namely ~--git-dir~ and ~--work-tree~. This would be a hassle to type all the time so we might as well add an alias for it in our ~$HOME/.bashrc~. In this case I'm calling it ~dots~ but it can be anything you prefer.

#+begin_src bash

  alias dots='/usr/bin/git --git-dir="$HOME"/.local/dotfiles --work-tree="$HOME"'

#+end_src


** Step 3: Additional configuration

** Ignore untracked files

By default, running ~git status~ will show all untracked files in the work tree. We don't want to have this for the the ~dots~ alias since we are only interested in the dotfiles we are tracking and not all the other files in our home directory so we have to add the following configuration for the bare repository.

#+begin_src bash

  dots config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

#+end_src

** Remove ~README~ and ~UNLICENSE~ from ~$HOME~

The ~README~ and ~UNLICENSE~ are located in the root of the dotfiles repository so that when they are pushed to the remote repository they will be recognized and rendered/processed(?) by gitlab and github. However, I don't want to keep them in my home directory and I would have just put them somewhere else if it was that simple which clearly is not the case based on the discussion in this [[https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/issues/93][issue]]. Luckily, I found a solution from the link and that is ~git sparse-checkout~. I just have to run the following.

#+begin_src bash

  dots config core.sparseCheckout true
  dots sparse-checkout set '/*' '!README.org' '!UNLICENSE'

#+end_src

The commands above are explained [[https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/issues/93#issuecomment-582585718][here]] and [[https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/issues/93#issuecomment-886667802][here]].

** Step 4: Manage the dotfiles

Now we can use the ~dots~ alias like a normal git command to manage dotfiles.
